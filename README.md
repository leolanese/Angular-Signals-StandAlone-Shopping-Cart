# Angular (17+) Signals Shopping-Cart

> Angular Signals represents a paradigm shift for e-commerce platforms, introducing a nimble and efficient approach to shopping cart management. With real-time updates, optimised performance, and streamlined state management, Angular Signals sets a new standard for enhancing user satisfaction and engagement in the realm of e-commerce applications.


## Goal

### Real-time Cart Updates: 
Angular Signals delivers instantaneous updates to the shopping cart, ensuring that any modifications made by users are promptly reflected. This feature revolutionizes the shopping experience, creating a dynamic and responsive environment.

### Optimised Performance: 
By selectively updating only the relevant portions of the cart, Angular Signals significantly enhances performance. This optimisation eliminates the need to reload entire cart components, resulting in faster response times and an overall smoother UX.

### Efficient State Management: 
Angular Signals streamlines state management, particularly in the context of dynamic shopping-carts (where the state can be udpated from multiple stand-alone components). As the cart undergoes modifications, only the relevant components are updated. This efficiently addresses the complexities associated with cart modifications, simplifying the development process and making it more robust.

### StandAlone & Signal: 
Use a single Service with the Signal and consume this reactive Signal from an StandAlone Component to compute operation and display them on real-time.
